"Topology (from the Greek words τόπος, 'place, location', and λόγος, 'study') is the branch of mathematics concerned with the properties of a geometric object that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, twisting, crumpling, and bending; that is, without closing holes, opening holes, tearing, gluing, or passing through itself." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology)

In the above sense, this notebook and scripts are not precisely a study of any particular topology → but a study of the landscape of skills associoated with job titles, and correlated with pay ranges.

I'm using a dataset from [Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics by U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#00-0000)
